Description: Utilities for EROFS File System
 EROFS (Enhanced Read-Only File System) is a lightweight
 read-only file system with modern designs (eg. page-sized
 blocks, inline xattrs/data, etc.) for scenarios which need
 high-performance read-only requirements, e.g. Android OS
 for smartphones and LIVECDs.
 .
 It also provides fixed-sized output compression support,
 which improves storage density, keeps relatively higher
 compression ratios, which is more useful to achieve high
 performance for embedded devices with limited memory.
